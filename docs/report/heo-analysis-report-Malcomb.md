# Planned revisions to the reproduction of the Malcomb et al's Study (2014)

Author: Katie Heo

## Analysis

I will be working on ... 

1. Changing the color scheme of the map that reflects differences between the reproduction and the original study for Figure 5. The current pastel purple-pastel pink scheme makes it difficult to tell the vulnerability level apart as the paler pink and purple areas blend. 

2. Exploring aggregation methods such as the geometric vulnerability score. The original study looks at the additive model only, which may lead to an incomplete understanding of vulnerability as the additive model assumes no interaction between the indicators.


## Results

1. This is a data visualization problem that can be fixed by changing the hex codes. I will use the hex codes of a divergent color scheme (green-brown) to clearly mark the areas that are clearly more or less vulnerable in the reproduction and the original study. 

2. Looking at the geometric vulnerability score would mean using a different calculation where the dataset is multiplied instead of added. This calculation will look at the interaction between the indicators.

## Discussion

1. If my revised map shows a clearer outline of which areas the reproduction has a higher vulnerability level, the original study has a higher vulnerability level, and which areas the reproduction and original study show equal vulnerability, it means that there is a better visualization of data in the map. This would make it easier to tell the white areas (reproduction - original = 0) apart as well as the hex codes I chose are darker shades than the previous pink and purple that made it difficult to identify certain areas.

2. The geometric method may emphasize the importance of addressing regions with more extreme vulnerabilities, which could be overlooked when using an additive approach. This change allows for a more comprehensive understanding of Malawi and can inform decisionmakers on where interventions are most urgently needed.
